# Disctionary-Manager-With-API-
This is an framework type,

*Just learn below things

- Express js, send/post/delete/port
- prompt(to take input) and u can pretty much guess how made it possible for res to be a sentence, just add description to new properties 
- basic If & Else Statements which is fundamental
- How to call function
- try and catch statements 

*Common Error
- Express/ prompt not a function, install these libraries. These are npms(node package managers lol)
